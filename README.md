# Facial-Expression-Recognition

The objective is to build a real time face expression recognition model that can classify each face based on the emotion shown into one of seven categories:
- 0=Angry
- 1=Disgust 
- 2=Fear
- 3=Happy
- 4=Sad
- 5=Surprise
- 6=Neutral

After training, saving, and exporting the CNN,  directly serve the trained model predictions to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.

**Used Keras, OpenCV and JSON.**
